  - Within the ossuary's grip, skeletal limbs claw at your garments, impeding your
    advance. You battle against the relentless grasps, inching closer to the coveted
    cup of coins.
  conditionSuccessText:
  - 'Entering the ossuary, skeletal limbs assail, gripping your clothing. Unyielding,
    your strength shatters brittle bones, clearing a path. Striding with ease, you
    approach the cup, undeterred by the feeble resistance of the vanquished remains.     '
