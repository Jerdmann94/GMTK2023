  - Your gaze penetrates the fish's essence, perceiving its otherworldly intelligence
    and enchanting aura. Disregarding the fisherman's protests, you release it. As
    it gracefully departs, an opal fishscale drifts to the surface, resonating with
    both wealth and sorcery. Holding it, you are consumed by its allure. The fisherman,
    pouting and famished, demands your departure with resentment in his eyes.
