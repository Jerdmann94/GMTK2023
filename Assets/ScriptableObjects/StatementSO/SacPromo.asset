  - 'With a heavy heart, you place the wounded man, shackled and weak, upon the accursed
    altar. Vile tendrils ensnare him, his muted moans filling the air. You turn away
    as his life dissipates. Returning your gaze, a silvered agate replaces him. Grasping
    it, an uncanny swiftness surges through you, empowering your every movement with
    an otherworldly grace.     '
