  conditionFailText:
  - 'Frantically rummaging through your pack, desperation fuels your search for rescue
    tools. Alas, time betrays you. As you raise your gaze, the canoe vanishes around
    the bend, the princess''s cries fading into the distance, lost to the depths
    of the dungeon''s embrace.     '
  conditionSuccessText:
  - 'Quick thinking takes hold as you hurl a rope from your pack, entwining it around
    the careening canoe''s horn. With a determined pull, you guide it safely to shore.
    The grateful princess presents her royal seal in gratitude but declines your
    offer of further escort. Resolute, you move onward, leaving her behind.     '
